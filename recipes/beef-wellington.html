    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gordon Ramsay's version of the classic steak dish – a showstopping centrepiece on a special occasion.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>beef fillet</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>chestnut mushroom</li>
        <li>butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.</li>
        <li>Sit the 1kg beef fillet on a roasting tray, brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper, then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins.</li>
        <li>While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry.</li>
    </ol>
